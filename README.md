# TempleFlashCard

This was my 3rd iOS project for my class. The professor, Dr. Liddle, provied some-what of a "foundation" starting point.

This app has a collection view of pictures that need to be matched with a items in a list.

Learned more about the interactions between collection views and table views! Awesome.
